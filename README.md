# Interface Between R and Google Maps

The function `gmapsdistance` uses the [Google Maps Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview?hl=en) to compute the distance(s) and time(s) between two points or two vectors of points using one of the four defined modes of transportation: `bicycling`, `walking`, `driving`, `transit`. The distance is returned in meters and the time in seconds. 

An [API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/get-api-key#key) is necessary to perform the query. Google maps must be able to find both the origin and the destination in order for the function to run. 

While the R package is open source the Distance Matrix API itself is a commercial service, requiring registration in all cases. 

A free tier is provided - $200 monthly credit. This is enough for 40,000 [Distance Matrix](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/usage-and-billing?w#distance-matrix) calls or 20,000 [Distance Matrix Advanced](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/usage-and-billing?w#distance-matrix-advanced) calls â€“ more than sufficient for most R package users.

Also note that using the API is subject to [Google Maps Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms/).


## Installation

```r
# CRAN install / stable version 
install.packages("gmapsdistance")

# Github installation / current dev version
remotes::install_github("jlacko/gmapsdistance")
```

## Examples of use
In this example we will compute the driving distance between Washington DC, and New York City. The code returns the `Time`, the `Distance` and the `Status` of the query (`OK` if it was successful).

``` r
results <- gmapsdistance(origin = "Washington DC", 
                        destination = "New York City NY", 
                        mode = "driving",
                        key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")) # your actual API key comes here...
results
# $Time
# [1] 14523
# 
# $Distance
# [1] 367656
# 
# $Status
# [1] "OK"
```

This example computes distance matrix between two vectors of cities at a specific departure time. The code displays resulting distance matrices using time (in seconds) and travel distance (in meters) as metrics.

``` r
results <- gmapsdistance(origin = c("Washington DC", "New York NY", "Seattle WA", "Miami FL"), 
                         destination = c("Washington DC", "New York NY", "Seattle WA", "Miami FL"), 
                         mode = "bicycling",
                         dep_date = "2022-05-31", # provided as string in ISO 8601 format
                         dep_time = "12:00:00", # provided as string in HH:MM:SS format
                         key = Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")) # your actual API key comes here...
                        
results$Time
#               Washington DC New York NY Seattle WA Miami FL
# Washington DC             0       76753     893416   353377
# New York NY           76537           0     917724   429533
# Seattle WA           890818      922255          0  1045150
